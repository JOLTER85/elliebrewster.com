    <h2>1. Focus on E-E-A-T</h2>
    <p>
      Google continues to prioritize websites that demonstrate <strong>Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness</strong>.
      Make sure your content is well-researched, includes author credentials, and cites reputable sources.
    </p>

    <h2>2. AI-Driven SEO</h2>
    <p>
      Tools powered by Artificial Intelligence are shaping keyword research, content creation, and on-page optimization.
      In 2025, leveraging AI for search intent analysis is no longer optional – it’s a must.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Core Web Vitals</h2>
    <p>
      Google’s Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) are critical ranking factors. Ensure your site loads quickly,
      is interactive without delays, and provides a smooth visual experience.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Content Personalization</h2>
    <p>
      Users expect tailored experiences. Personalizing content based on location, device, or browsing history
      can significantly improve engagement and rankings.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Voice and Visual Search</h2>
    <p>
      Optimize your content for voice queries (long-tail conversational keywords) and visual search
      (structured data + high-quality images).
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      SEO in 2025 is all about combining <strong>AI, technical excellence, and user-centric content</strong>.
      Brands that adapt quickly will dominate search results.
